“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your
friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to {{her}}.”

“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am
not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so
teazing?”

“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance
is certainly very little. One cannot know what
a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if {{we}} do
not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long
and her neices must stand their chance; and therefore,
as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the
office, I will take it on myself.”

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,
“Nonsense, nonsense!”

“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?”
cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction,
and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?
I cannot quite agree with you {{there}}. What say you,
Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know,
and read great books, and make extracts.”

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew
not how.

“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued,
“let us return to Mr. Bingley.”

“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.

“I am sorry to hear {{that}}; but why did not you tell
me so before? If I had known as much this morning,
I certainly would not have called on him. It is very
unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot
escape the acquaintance now.”

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished;
that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though
when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare
that it was what she had expected all the while.

“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But
I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you
loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too,
