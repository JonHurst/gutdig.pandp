CHAPTER IV.

When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who
had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before,
expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.

“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she,
“sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such
happy manners! – so much ease, with such perfect good
breeding!”

“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which
a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.
His character is thereby complete.”

“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance
a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.”

“Did not you? {{I}} did for you. But that is one great
difference between us. Compliments always take {{you}} by
surprise, and {{me}} never. What could be more natural than
his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you
were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well,
he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to
like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”

“Dear Lizzy!”

“Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like
people in general. You never see a fault in any body.
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never
heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”

“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one;
but I always speak what I think.”

“I know you do; and it is {{that}} which makes the wonder.
With {{your}} good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies
and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common
enough; – one meets it every where. But to be candid
without ostentation or design – to take the good of every
body’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
