such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening for wit to
have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot
be always laughing at a man without now and then
stumbling on something witty.”

“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you
could not treat the matter as you do now.”

“Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough.
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with
no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort
me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain
and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!”

“How unfortunate that you should have used such very
strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy,
for now they {{do}} appear wholly undeserved.”

“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with
bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices
I had been encouraging. There is one point, on which
I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought,
or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham’s character.”

Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, “Surely
there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.
What is your own opinion?”

“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has
not authorised me to make his communication public.
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister,
was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself;
and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest
of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice
against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be
the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt
to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it.
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not
signify to anybody here, what he really is. Sometime
hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh
at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present
I will say nothing about it.”
