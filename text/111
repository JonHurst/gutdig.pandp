“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet,
alarmed. “Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as
these. In every thing else she is as good natured a girl
as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we
shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying
instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the
library,

“Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we
are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy
marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him,
and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have {{her}}.”

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered,
and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which
was not in the least altered by her communication.

“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said
he, when she had finished her speech. “Of what are you
talking?”

“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not
have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he
will not have Lizzy.”

“And what am I to do on the occasion? – It seems an
hopeless business.”

“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you
insist upon her marrying him.”

“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was
summoned to the library.

“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.
“I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand
that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.
Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was. “Very well – and
this offer of marriage you have refused?”

“I have, Sir.”

“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother
insists upon your accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?”

“Yes, or I will never see her again.”
