“You know nothing of the matter. {{That}} is all to be
forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as
I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is
unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember
it myself.”

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth
again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.

“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must
believe you,” cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would – I
do congratulate you – but are you certain? forgive the
question – are you quite certain that you can be happy
with him?”

“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between
us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the
world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have
such a brother?”

“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley
or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked
of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well
enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry
without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what
you ought to do?”

“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel {{more}} than I ought
to do, when I tell you all.”

“What do you mean?”

“Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do
Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry.”

“My dearest sister, now {{be}} serious. I want to talk
very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to
know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have
loved him?”

“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly
know when it began. But I believe I must date it from
my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”

Another intreaty that she would be serious, however,
produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane
by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced
on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.
