loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you
are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your
proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise
than decline them.”

“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with
a formal wave of the hand, “that it is usual with young
ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they
secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a
second or even a third time. I am therefore by no means
discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope
to lead you to the altar ere long.”

“Upon my word, Sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is
rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. I do
assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such
young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their
happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.
I am perfectly serious in my refusal. – You could not
make {{me}} happy, and I am convinced that I am the last
woman in the world who would make {{you}} so. – Nay, were
your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded
she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.”

“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,”
said Mr. Collins very gravely – “but I cannot imagine
that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And
you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing
her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.”

“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and
pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish
you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand,
do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In
making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy
of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take
possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without
any self-reproach. This matter may be considered,
