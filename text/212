summer, I made a point of her having two men servants
go with her. – Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,
of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared
with propriety in a different manner. – I am excessively
attentive to all those things. You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to
me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to
{{you}} to let them go alone.”

“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”

“Oh! – Your uncle! – He keeps a man-servant, does
he? – I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of
those things. Where shall you change horses? – Oh!
Bromley, of course. – If you mention my name at the
Bell, you will be attended to.”

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask
respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them
all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth
believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied,
she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection
must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was
alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and
not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which
she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

Mr. Darcy’s letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing
by heart. She studied every sentence: and her feelings
towards its writer were at times widely different. When
she remembered the style of his address, she was still
full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was
turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings
became the object of compassion. His attachment excited
gratitude, his general character respect; but she could
not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent
her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see
him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant
source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy
defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
