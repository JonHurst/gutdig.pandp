“No” – said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension.
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
My temper I dare not vouch for. – It is I believe
too little yielding – certainly too little for the convenience
of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to
move them. My temper would perhaps be called
resentful. – My good opinion once lost is lost for ever.”

“{{That}} is a failing indeed!” – cried Elizabeth. “Implacable
resentment {{is}} a shade in a character. But you
have chosen your fault well. – I really cannot {{laugh}} at it.
You are safe from me.”

“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency
to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even
the best education can overcome.”

“And {{your}} defect is a propensity to hate every body.”

“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is wilfully to
misunderstand them.”

“Do let us have a little music,” – cried Miss Bingley,
tired of a conversation in which she had no share. –
“Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst.”

Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the
piano forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments
recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the
danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
