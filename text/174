Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she
sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair
near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and
then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the
latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual
deliberation towards the piano forte, stationed himself so
as to command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance.
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the
first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile,
and said,

“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in
all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed
though your sister {{does}} play so well. There is a stubbornness
about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others. My courage always rises with every
attempt to intimidate me.”

“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied,
“because you could not really believe me to entertain
any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure
of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which
in fact are not your own.”

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself,
and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give
you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to
believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting
with a person so well able to expose my real character,
in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself
off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is
very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to
my disadvantage in Hertfordshire – and, give me leave
to say, very impolitic too – for it is provoking me to
retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock
your relations to hear.”

“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.

“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,”
cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how
he behaves among strangers.”
