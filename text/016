of his own; but though he was now established only as
a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to
preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married
a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to
consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr.
Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was
tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at
Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half
an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise,
and took it immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady
friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. –
Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness,
ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer
a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s
regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment
the highest opinion. In understanding Darcy was
the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but
Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well
bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had
greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked
wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving
offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton
assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had
never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his
life; every body had been most kind and attentive to
him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had
soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss
Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none
of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none
received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he
acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.
