to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus
removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth
and Catherine for a considerable time, without making
any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe
her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently
said, “What is the matter mamma? What do you keep
winking at me for? What am I to do?”

“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.”
She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to
waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and

“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”

Elizabeth was forced to go.

“We may as well leave them by themselves you

“Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing room.”

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother,
but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were
out of sight, then returned into the drawing room.

Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and
before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly
through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming
next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley;
