My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the
others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday
morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid
you know that something would happen to put it off, and
then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and
talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However,
I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was
thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.

“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I
thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are
to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid
unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was
there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the
little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage
came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know,
when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well,
I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my
uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the
hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all
set out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he
{{had}} been prevented going, the wedding need not be put
off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”

“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

“Oh, yes! – he was to come there with Wickham, you
know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to
have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully!
What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”

“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another
word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking
no further.”

“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with
curiosity; “we will ask you no questions.”
