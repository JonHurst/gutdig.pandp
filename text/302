“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”

“Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?”

“What is there of good to be expected?” said he,
taking the letter from his pocket; “but perhaps you
would like to read it.”

Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane
now came up.

“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know
myself what it is about.”

“Gracechurch-street, Monday,
August 2.

“{{My dear Brother}},

“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my
niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you
satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was
fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they
were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet. It is enough
to know they are discovered, I have seen them both———”

“Then it is, as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they
are married!”

Elizabeth read on; “I have seen them both. They
are not married, nor can I find there was any intention
of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements
which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope
it will not be long before they are. All that is required
of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among
your children after the decease of yourself and my sister;
and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing
her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.
These are conditions, which, considering every thing, I had
no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought
myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express,
that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that
Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they
are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived
