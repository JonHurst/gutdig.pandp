Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them
next to your great uncle the judge. They are in the
same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for
your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful
eyes?”

“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression,
but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably
fine, might be copied.”

At that moment they were met from another walk, by
Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.

“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said
Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been
overheard.

“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst,
“in running away without telling us that you were coming
out.”

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left
Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted
three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately
said, –

“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had
better go into the avenue.”

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to
remain with them, laughingly answered,

“No, no; stay where you are. – You are charmingly
group’d, and appear to uncommon advantage. The
picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.
Good bye.”

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about,
in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane
was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her
room for a couple of hours that evening.
