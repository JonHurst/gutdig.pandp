dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what
we were talking of.”

“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William
could not have interrupted any two people in the room
who had less to say for themselves. – We have tried two
or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”

“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.

“Books – Oh! no. – I am sure we never read the same,
or not with the same feelings.”

“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case,
there can at least be no want of subject. – We may
compare our different opinions.”

“No – I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head
is always full of something else.”

“The {{present}} always occupies you in such scenes – does
it?” said he, with a look of doubt.

“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she
said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject,
as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,
“I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you
hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created
was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose,
as to its {{being created}}.”

“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.

“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”

“I hope not.”

“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change
their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”

“May I ask to what these questions tend?”

“Merely to the illustration of {{your}} character,” said she,
endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to
make it out.”

“And what is your success?”

She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear
such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
