principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,
joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with
Miss Bennet.

Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in
watching Mr. Darcy’s progress through {{his}} book, as in
reading her own; and she was perpetually either making
some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win
him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered
her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted
by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which
she had only chosen because it was the second volume
of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all
there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner
one tires of any thing than of a book! – When I have
a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an
excellent library.”

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw
aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in
quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother
mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating
a dance at Netherfield? – I would advise you, before
you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present
party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among
us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than
a pleasure.”

“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go
to bed, if he chuses, before it begins – but as for the ball,
it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has
made white soup enough I shall send round my cards.”

“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if
they were carried on in a different manner; but there is
something insufferably tedious in the usual process of
such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational
if conversation instead of dancing made the order of
the day.”
