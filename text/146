ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected
herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went
down stairs together, Charlotte said,

“I shall depend on hearing from you very often,
Eliza.”

“{{That}} you certainly shall.”

“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come
and see me?”

“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”

“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise
me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.”

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little
pleasure in the visit.

“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,”
added Charlotte, “and I hope you will consent to be of
the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me
as either of them.”

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set
off for Kent from the church door, and every body had
as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. Elizabeth
soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence
was as regular and frequent as it had ever been;
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that
all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though
determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for
the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s
first letters were received with a good deal of
eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how
she would speak of her new home, how she would like
Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce
herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth
felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point
exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully,
seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood,
and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady
Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and obliging.
