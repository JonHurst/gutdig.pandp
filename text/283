might strike them that they could be more economically,
though less expeditiously, married in London, than in
Scotland.”

“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection?
Why must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this
is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by
Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending to
marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without
some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has
Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and
good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego
every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As
to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps
might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am
not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that
such a step might produce. But as to your other objection,
I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from
my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little
attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going
forward in his family, that {{he}} would do as little, and
think as little about it, as any father could do, in such
a matter.”

“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing
but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any
other terms than marriage?”

“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied
Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense
of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of
doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps
I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she
has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and
for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has
been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most
idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions
that came in her way. Since the ———shire were first
quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and
