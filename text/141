strong attachment. Pray, how {{violent was}} Mr. Bingley’s
love?”

“I never saw a more promising inclination. He was
growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly
engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more
decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two
or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and
I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.
Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility
the very essence of love?”

“Oh, yes! – of that kind of love which I suppose him
to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because,
with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.
It had better have happened to {{you}}, Lizzy; you would
have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think
she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change
of scene might be of service – and perhaps a little relief
from home, may be as useful as anything.”

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal,
and felt persuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence.

“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration
with regard to this young man will influence her. We live
in so different a part of town, all our connections are so
different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that
it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he
really comes to see her.”

“And {{that}} is quite impossible; for he is now in the
custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer
him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear
aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps
have {{heard}} of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse
him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and
depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”

“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at
all. But does not Jane correspond with the sister? {{She}}
will not be able to help calling.”

“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
