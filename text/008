that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now.”

“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse,”
said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room,
fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she,
when the door was shut. “I do not know how you will
ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either,
for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant
I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day;
but for your sakes, we would do any thing. Lydia, my
love, though you {{are}} the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley
will dance with you at the next ball.”

“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for
though I {{am}} the youngest, I’m the tallest.”

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how
soon he would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining
when they should ask him to dinner.
