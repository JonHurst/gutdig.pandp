Well, he is a very undeserving young man – and I do not
suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever
getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield
again in the summer; and I have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know.”

“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield
any more.”

“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants
him to come. Though I shall always say that he used
my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would
not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry
for what he has done.”

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any
such expectation, she made no answer.

“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother soon afterwards,
“and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?
Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table
do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare
say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving
enough. There is nothing extravagant in {{their}} housekeeping,
I dare say.”

“No, nothing at all.”

“A great deal of good management, depend upon it.
Yes, yes. {{They}} will take care not to outrun their income.
{{They}} will never be distressed for money. Well, much good
may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of
having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look
upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that
happens.”

“It was a subject which they could not mention before
me.”

“No. It would have been strange if they had. But
I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully
their own, so much the better. {{I}} should be ashamed of
having one that was only entailed on me.”
