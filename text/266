the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her
known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude – for
to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as
by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly
defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful
to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she
only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the
happiness of both that she should employ the power,
which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing
on the renewal of his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt
and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s,
in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at
Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast,
ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently,
that it would be highly expedient to wait on
her at Pemberley the following morning. They were,
therefore, to go. – Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she
asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing
scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive
engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at
Pemberley by noon.
