would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female
minds. But I confess they would have no charms for {{me}}.
I should infinitely prefer a book.”

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom
listened to any body for more than half a minute, and
never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the
girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on;
but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should
not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home
half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She
dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid
it as long as possible. The comfort to {{her}}, of the regiment’s
approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression. In
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home, before she found
that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them
a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between
her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had
not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers
were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her
mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired
of succeeding at last.
