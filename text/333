if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan’t
prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.
We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That
will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just
room at table for him.”

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to
bear her husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying
to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley
in consequence of it, before {{they}} did. As the day of his
arrival drew near,

“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane
to her sister. “It would be nothing; I could see him
with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear
it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much
I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his
stay at Netherfield is over!”

“I wish I could say any thing to comfort you,” replied
Elizabeth; “but it is wholly out of my power. You
must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching
patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.”

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance
of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings
of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her
side, might be as long as it could. She counted the days
that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning
after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her
dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards
the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth,
to satisfy her mother, went to the window – she looked, – she
saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her
sister.

“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty;
“who can it be?”
