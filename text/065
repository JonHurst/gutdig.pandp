doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in
marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of
some of his hearers, but Mrs. Bennet, who quarrelled with
no compliments, answered most readily,

“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all
my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute
enough. Things are settled so oddly.”

“You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate.”

“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my
poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find
fault with {{you}}, for such things I know are all chance in
this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when
once they come to be entailed.”

“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my
fair cousins, – and could say much on the subject, but that
I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared
to admire them. At present I will not say more, but
perhaps when we are better acquainted———”

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the
girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects
of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The hall, the dining-room,
and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his
commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.
Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his
viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too
in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know
to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery
was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet,
who assured him with some asperity that they were very
well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had
nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having
displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself
not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for
about a quarter of an hour.
