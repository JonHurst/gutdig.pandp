“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great
disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public
notice of Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner; nay,

Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject;
and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever
you and Jane are known, you must be respected and
