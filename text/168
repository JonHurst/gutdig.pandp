CHAPTER VII.

Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his
visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter’s
being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such
a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins
devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and
shewing him the country; but when he went away, the
whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more
of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time
between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him
either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and
looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted
the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should
not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was
a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but
she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for
what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one
equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the
arrangement.

From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing
in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the
knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often
especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which
he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped
at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation
with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to
get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk
to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think
