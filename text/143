it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of
her former friends, than she had been in the way of
procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late
Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently
was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing
her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description
which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute
of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted
with the present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried
to remember something of that gentleman’s reputed disposition
when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and
was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
ill-natured boy.
