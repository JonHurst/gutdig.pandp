about it – but I hardly know what – something about
Mr. Robinson.”

“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him
and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr.
Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies,
and whether he did not think there were a great
many pretty women in the room, and {{which}} he thought
the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last
question – Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt,
there cannot be two opinions on that point.”

“Upon my word! – Well, that was very decided indeed – that
does seem as if———but however, it may all come
to nothing you know.”

“{{My}} overhearings were more to the purpose than {{yours}},
Eliza,” said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth
listening to as his friend, is he? – Poor Eliza! – to be only
just {{tolerable}}.”

“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to
be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable
man that it would be quite a misfortune to be
liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his
lips.”

“Are you quite sure, Ma’am? – is not there a little
mistake?” said Jane. – “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy
speaking to her.”

“Aye – because she asked him at last how he liked
Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; – but
she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.”

“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never
speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.
With {{them}} he is remarkably agreeable.”

“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been
so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long.
But I can guess how it was; every body says that he is
ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow
that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come
to the ball in a hack chaise.”
