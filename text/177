CHAPTER IX.

Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and
writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone
on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring
at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had
heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting
away her half-finished letter that she might escape all
impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her
very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,
entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and
apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he
had understood all the ladies to be within.

They then sat down, and when her enquiries after
Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into
total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to
think of something, and in this emergence recollecting
{{when}} she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their
hasty departure, she observed,

“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last
November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable
surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so
soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you
left London.”

“Perfectly so – I thank you.”

She found that she was to receive no other answer – and,
after a short pause, added,

“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not
much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?”

“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable
that he may spend very little of his time there in future.
