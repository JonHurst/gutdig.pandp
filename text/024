He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step
towards conversing with her himself, attended to her
conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice.
It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were
assembled.

“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte,
“by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”

“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”

“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him
know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical
eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself,
I shall soon grow afraid of him.”

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though
without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss
Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him,
which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself
uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel
Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?”

“With great energy; – but it is a subject which always
makes a lady energetic.”

“You are severe on us.”

“It will be {{her}} turn soon to be teazed,” said Miss
Lucas. “I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and
you know what follows.”

“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend! – always
wanting me to play and sing before any body and
every body! – If my vanity had taken a musical turn,
you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in
the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss
Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well;
if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at
Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which every body
here is of course familiar with – ‘Keep your breath to cool
your porridge,’ – and I shall keep mine to swell my
song.”
