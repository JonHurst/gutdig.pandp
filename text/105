incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty
walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins
began.

“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your
modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather
adds to your other perfections. You would have been
less amiable in my eyes had there {{not}} been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have
your respected mother’s permission for this address.
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,
however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble;
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out
as the companion of my future life. But before I am run
away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will
be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying – and
moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the
design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure,
being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so
near laughing that she could not use the short pause he
allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he
continued:

“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it
a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances
(like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his
parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very
greatly to my happiness; and thirdly – which perhaps
I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular
advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom
I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she
condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on
this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night
before I left Hunsford – between our pools at quadrille,
while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh’s
foot-stool, that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry.
A clergyman like you must marry. – Chuse properly, chuse
