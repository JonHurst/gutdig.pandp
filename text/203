intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my
father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every
particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of
{{me}} should make {{my}} assertions valueless, you cannot be
prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin;
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him,
I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this
letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will
only add, God bless you.
