“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your
parents. – Your mother will never see you again if you
do {{not}} marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you {{do}}.”

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of
such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded
herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished,
was excessively disappointed.

“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this
way? You promised me to {{insist}} upon her marrying him.”

“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small
favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free
use of my understanding on the present occasion; and
secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library
to myself as soon as may be.”

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her
husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked
to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her
by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest,
but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering; – and
Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes
with playful gaiety replied to her attacks. Though
her manner varied however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on
what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend
on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and
though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility
of her deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his
feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte
Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met
in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a
half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! – What do you think has happened this
morning? – Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will
not have him.”
