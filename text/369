learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as
its remembrance gives you pleasure.”

“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the
kind. {{Your}} retrospections must be so totally void of
reproach, that the contentment arising from them, is not
of philosophy, but what is much better, of ignorance.
But with {{me}}, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude,
which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have
been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in
principle. As a child I was taught what was {{right}}, but
I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good
principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only {{child}})
I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves,
(my father particularly, all that was benevolent and
amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be
selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own
family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world,
to {{wish}} at least to think meanly of their sense and worth
compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight
and twenty; and such I might still have been but for
you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you!
You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came
to you without a doubt of my reception. You shewed
me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please
a woman worthy of being pleased.”

“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”

“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity?
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.”

“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally
I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but
my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must
have hated me after {{that}} evening?”

“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my
anger soon began to take a proper direction.”

“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me;
when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”
