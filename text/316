but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his
character and his marriage been exactly what they ought,
his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their
relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth
had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance;
but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no
limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.
{{She}} blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of
colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and her
mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and
Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began
enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable
to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have
the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past
was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to
subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

“Only think of its being three months,” she cried,
“since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare;
and yet there have been things enough happened in the
time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back
again! though I thought it would be very good fun if
I was.”

Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed.
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who
never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be
insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the people
here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid
they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in
his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and
so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my
glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame,
so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and
smiled like any thing.”
