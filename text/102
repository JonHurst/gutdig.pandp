success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her
sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice,
and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed
by the folly which he must have witnessed. That
his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such
an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough,
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt
of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were
more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.
She was teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly
by her side, and though he could not prevail
with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power
to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand
up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any
young lady in the room. He assured her that as to dancing,
he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object
was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her,
and that he should therefore make a point of remaining
close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing
upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her
friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly
engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s
farther notice; though often standing within a very short
distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near
enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence
of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company
to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to
wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every
body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.
Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths
except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient
to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every
attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing,
threw a languor over the whole party, which was very
