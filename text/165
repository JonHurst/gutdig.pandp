“Then, who taught you? who attended to you?
Without a governess you must have been neglected.”

“Compared with some families, I believe we were;
but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the

“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will

pleasures of youth, as the first. And to be kept back on
{{such}} a motive! – I think it would not be very likely to

“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your
