He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Every body is
disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more
favourably spoken of by any one.”

“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after
a short interruption, “that he or that any man should
not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with {{him}}
I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded
by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high
