I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance
I require.”

“And I certainly {{never}} shall give it. I am not to be
intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your
ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but
would my giving you the wished-for promise, make {{their}}
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be
attached to me, would {{my}} refusing to accept his hand,
make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to
say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you
have supported this extraordinary application, have been
as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have
widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be
worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in {{his}} affairs,
I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern
yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned
no farther on the subject.”

“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means
done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have
still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars
of your youngest sister’s infamous elopement. I know
it all; that the young man’s marrying her, was a patched-up
business, at the expence of your father and uncles.
And is {{such}} a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is {{her}} husband,
is the son of his late father’s steward, to be his brother?
Heaven and earth! – of what are you thinking? Are the
shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”

“You can {{now}} have nothing farther to say,” she resentfully
answered. “You have insulted me, in every possible
method. I must beg to return to the house.”

And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also,
and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly
incensed.

“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit
of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider
that a connection with you, must disgrace him in
the eyes of everybody?”
