sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid
vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the
whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that
Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that
they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that
the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however,
were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth
was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and
on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest
of the day. Nothing could console and nothing appease
her. – Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week
elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding
her, a month passed away before she could speak to
Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many
months were gone before she could at all forgive their
daughter.

Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the
occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced
to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he
said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been
used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife,
and more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match;
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest
desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade
her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were
far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only
a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than
as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being
able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a
daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn
rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks
might have been enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint
which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and
