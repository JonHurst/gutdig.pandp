“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said
Miss Lucas, “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”

“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not
dance with {{him}}, if I were you.”

“I believe, Ma’am, I may safely promise you {{never}} to
dance with him.”

“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend {{me}} so
much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with
family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think
highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a {{right}}
to be proud.”

“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could
easily forgive {{his}} pride, if he had not mortified {{mine}}.”

“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the
solidity of her reflections, “is a very common failing I
believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced
that it is very common indeed, that human nature is
particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of
us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on
the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words
are often used synonimously. A person may be proud
without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion
of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think
of us.”

“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas
who came with his sisters, “I should not care how proud
I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink
a bottle of wine every day.”

“Then you would drink a great deal more than you
ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at
it I should take away your bottle directly.”

The boy protested that she should not; she continued
to declare that she would, and the argument ended only
with the visit.
