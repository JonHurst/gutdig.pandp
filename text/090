wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose
blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and
though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the
evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and
having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she
had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a
voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and
to point him out to her particular notice. The two first
dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and
misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances
can give. The moment of her release from him was exstacy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment
of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was
universally liked. When those dances were over she
returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation
with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by
Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his
application for her hand, that, without knowing what she
did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately,
and she was left to fret over her own want of presence
of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.

“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”

“Heaven forbid! – {{That}} would be the greatest misfortune
of all! – To find a man agreeable whom one is
determined to hate! – Do not wish me such an evil.”

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy
approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help
cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and
allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set,
amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being
allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her
neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
