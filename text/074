inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could
only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.
Denny had brought him from London, and that he was
to have a lieutenant’s commission in the ———shire. She
had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked
up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared
Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows
now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with
the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.”
Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next
day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call
on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the
family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This
was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips protested that they would
have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and
a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of
such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual
good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting
the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that
they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what
she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though
Jane would have defended either or both, had they
appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet
by admiring Mrs. Philips’s manners and politeness. He
protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter,
he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had
not only received him with the utmost civility, but had
even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next
evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something
he supposed might be attributed to his connection
with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.
