ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce;
but with respect to any other leading characteristic,
I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”

“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all
my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow,
I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as
if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of
chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so
well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand,
it does not advance their felicity in the least. They
always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know
as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom
you are to pass your life.”

“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.
You know it is not sound, and that you would never
act in this way yourself.”

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her
sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was
herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes
of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed
her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration
at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her
only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to
himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature
in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly
intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark
eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally
mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye
more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form,
he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners
were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught
by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly
unaware; – to her he was only the man who made himself
agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome
enough to dance with.
