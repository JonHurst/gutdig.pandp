her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying,
yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial,
and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded,
as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming
all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger
impression on his mind than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister, was not
unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the
contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest
of her family; – and as she considered that Jane’s disappointment
had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both
must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt
depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving
way to every variety of thought; re-considering events,
determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well
as she could, to a change so sudden and so important,
fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with
the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution
of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for
conversation.

She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from
Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy,
only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel
Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour,
hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after
her till she could be found. – Elizabeth could but just
{{affect}} concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object. She could
think only of her letter.
