farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks,
and she said,

“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established
mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments
avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is
natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could {{feel}}
gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot – I have
never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned
pain to any one. It has been most unconsciously
done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty
in overcoming it after this explanation.”

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece
with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words
with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion
became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind
was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips,
till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause
was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length, in a voice
of forced calmness, he said,

“And this is all the reply which I am to have the
honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed
why, with so little {{endeavour}} at civility, I am thus
rejected. But it is of small importance.”

“I might as well enquire,” replied she, “why with so
evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose
to tell me that you liked me against your will, against
your reason, and even against your character? Was not
this some excuse for incivility, if I {{was}} uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own
feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent,
or had they even been favourable, do you think that any
consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness
of a most beloved sister?”
