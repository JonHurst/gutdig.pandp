It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings
rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she
must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to
announce their safe arrival in London; and when she
wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power
to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well
rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week

inattention. After waiting at home every morning for
a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse
for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness
of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner,
would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter
