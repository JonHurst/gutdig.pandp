CHAPTER III.

Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s
dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not
help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at
Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady’s side, the acquaintance
would now be renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shewn through the
hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it
delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground,
admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills
behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish
chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who
was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and
the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana’s
reception of them was very civil; but attended with all
that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness
and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to
those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being
proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,
did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only
by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward
as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few
moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel,
agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce
some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well
bred than either of the others; and between her and
Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the
conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes
did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger
of its being heard.
