“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane
would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy!
Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have
been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it been for

It does not often happen that the interference of friends
will persuade a young man of independent fortune to
think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love
with only a few days before.”

“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so
hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me
very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which
arise from an half-hour’s acquaintance, as to a real,
