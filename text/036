“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my
countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why
must {{she}} be scampering about the country, because her
sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!”

“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat,
six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the
gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its
office.”

“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said
Bingley; “but this was all lost upon me. I thought
Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she
came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice.”

“{{You}} observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss
Bingley; “and I am inclined to think that you would
not wish to see {{your sister}} make such an exhibition.”

“Certainly not.”

“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or
whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite
alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me
to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum.”

“It shews an affection for her sister that is very
pleasing,” said Bingley.

“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in
a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected
your admiration of her fine eyes.”

“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by
the exercise.” – A short pause followed this speech, and
Mrs. Hurst began again.

“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is
really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she
were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and
such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.”

“I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an
attorney in Meryton.”

“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere
near Cheapside.”
