as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her
composure, and calmly replied,

“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? – Do
you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to
procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so
happy as to succeed with you?”

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a
strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable
firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful
to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.

“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte, – “you
must be surprised, very much surprised, – so lately as
Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you
have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you
know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home;
and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connections, and
situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness
with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.”

Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” – and
after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the
family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth
was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was
a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea
of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s
making two offers of marriage within three days, was
nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She
had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have
supposed it possible that when called into action, she
would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly
advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most
humiliating picture! – And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the
distressing conviction that it was impossible for that
friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.
