Bingley; “but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.
Wont it, Kitty?”

Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy
professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount,
and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs
to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying,

“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced
to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope
you will not mind it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know;
and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just
now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.”

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s
consent should be asked in the course of the evening.
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her
mother’s. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth
and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence
of the man. But whether she were violently set
against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was
certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to
do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that
Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than
the first vehemence of her disapprobation.

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the
library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and
her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear
her father’s opposition, but he was going to be made
unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that
{{she}}, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her
choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in
disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat
in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking
at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few
minutes he approached the table where she was sitting
with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work,
said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he wants you in
the library.” She was gone directly.
