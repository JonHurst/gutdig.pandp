the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment
for the kindness of his brother, though expressed
most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to
fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He
had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed
on to marry his daughter, it would be done with
so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year
the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them;
for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the
continual presents in money, which passed to her, through
her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expences had been very little
within that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on
his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his
chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the
business as possible. When the first transports of rage
which had produced his activity in seeking her were over,
he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His
letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking
business, he was quick in its execution. He begged
to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to
his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any
message to her.

The good news quickly spread through the house; and
with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It
was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be
sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation,
had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town;
or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the
world, in some distant farm house. But there was much
to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured
wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before,
from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but
little of their spirit in this change of circumstances,
because with such an husband, her misery was considered
certain.
