But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected
to place this point, as well as the still more interesting
one of Bingley’s being withheld from seeing Jane, she
felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on
examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable,
that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence
of his friends successfully combated by the more natural
influence of Jane’s attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with

spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire,
to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance
in common; and, though Wickham had been little
there since the death of Darcy’s father, five years before,
