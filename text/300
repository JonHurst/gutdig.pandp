I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap
and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can, – or,
perhaps, I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.”

“I am not going to run away, Papa,” said Kitty,
fretfully; “if {{I}} should ever go to Brighton, I would
behave better than Lydia.”

“{{You}} go to Brighton! – I would not trust you so near
it as East Bourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have
at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects
of it. No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even
to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove,
that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational
manner.”

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light,
began to cry.

“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy.
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take
you to a review at the end of them.”
