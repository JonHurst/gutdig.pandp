any thing so abominable. How shall we punish him for
such a speech?”

“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,”
said Elizabeth. “We can all plague and punish one
another. Teaze him – laugh at him. – Intimate as you
are, you must know how it is to be done.”

“But upon my honour I do {{not}}. I do assure you that
my intimacy has not yet taught me {{that}}. Teaze calmness of
temper and presence of mind! No, no – I feel he may defy
us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves,
if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.
Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”

“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth.
“That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope
it will continue, for it would be a great loss to {{me}} to have
many such acquaintance. I dearly love a laugh.”

“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more
than can be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the
wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous
by a person whose first object in life is a joke.”

“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth – “there are such people,
but I hope I am not one of {{them}}. I hope I never ridicule
what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and
inconsistencies {{do}} divert me, I own, and I laugh at them
whenever I can. – But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without.”

“Perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has
been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which
often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.”

“Such as vanity and pride.”

“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride – where
there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always
under good regulation.”

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,”
said Miss Bingley; – “and pray what is the result?”

“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has
no defect. He owns it himself without disguise.”
