every following sentence added to its exuberance. She
was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know
that her daughter would be married was enough. She
was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled
by any remembrance of her misconduct.

“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “This is delightful
indeed! – She will be married! – I shall see her again! – She
will be married at sixteen! – My good, kind brother! – I
knew how it would be – I knew he would manage every
thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham
too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write
to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my
dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much
he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the
bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment.
My dear, dear Lydia! – How merry we shall be together
when we meet!”

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to
the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts
to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid
them all under.

“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she
added, “in a great measure, to his kindness. We are
persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham
with money.”

“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who
should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had
a family of his own, I and my children must have had all
his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever
had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well!
I am so happy. In a short time, I shall have a daughter
married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds. And she
was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such
a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate,
and you write for me. We will settle with your father
about the money afterwards; but the things should be
ordered immediately.”
