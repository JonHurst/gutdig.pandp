CHAPTER XVIII.

The first week of their return was soon gone. The
second began. It was the last of the regiment’s stay in
Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood
were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal.
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.
Very frequently were they reproached for this
insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was
extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness
in any of the family.

“Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are
we to do!” would they often exclaim in the bitterness
of woe. “How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?”

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she
remembered what she had herself endured on a similar
occasion, five and twenty years ago.

“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together
when Colonel Millar’s regiment went away. I thought
I should have broke my heart.”

“I am sure I shall break {{mine}},” said Lydia.

“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs.
Bennet.

“Oh, yes! – if one could but go to Brighton! But papa
is so disagreeable.”

“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”

“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do {{me}} a great
deal of good,” added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually
through Longbourn-house. Elizabeth tried to
be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost
in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s objections;
and never had she before been so much disposed
to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.
