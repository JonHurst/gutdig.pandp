CHAPTER XVII.

“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking
to?” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane
as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others
when they sat down to table. She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond
her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but
neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of
the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing
extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and
laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not
of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather {{knew}} that
she was happy, than {{felt}} herself to be so; for, besides the
immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before
her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when
her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others
it was a {{dislike}} which not all his fortune and consequence
might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion
was very far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she
was absolutely incredulous here.

“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! – engaged to
Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know
it to be impossible.”

“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence
was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe
me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak
nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged.”

Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot
be. I know how much you dislike him.”
