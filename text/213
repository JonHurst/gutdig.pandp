They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented
with laughing at them, would never exert himself to
restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and
her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was
entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence

with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own

When to these recollections was added the developement
of Wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that
the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before,

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during
the last week of her stay, as they had been at first. The
very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship
again enquired minutely into the particulars of their
journey, gave them directions as to the best method of
packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing
