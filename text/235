I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to
be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with
Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much
at heart.‚Äù

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she
answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She
saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of
his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the {{appearance}},
on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther
attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last
with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never
meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out
early the next morning. The separation between her and
her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation
and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes
for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her
injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of
enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and
in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding
farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered
without being heard.
