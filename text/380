CHAPTER XVIII.

Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she
wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen
in love with her. “How could you begin?” said she.
“I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you
had once made a beginning; but what could set you off
in the first place?”

“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or
the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago.
I was in the middle before I knew that I {{had}} begun.”

“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my
manners – my behaviour to {{you}} was at least always
bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without
rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be
sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”

“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”

“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was
very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility,
of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted
with the women who were always speaking and looking,
and thinking for {{your}} approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike {{them}}. Had you
not been really amiable you would have hated me for it;
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself,
your feelings were always noble and just; and in your
heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There – I have saved you the trouble
of accounting for it; and really, all things considered,
I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you
knew no actual good of me – but nobody thinks of {{that}}
when they fall in love.”

“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to
Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?”
