run such a risk. But against this, there were objections;
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource,
if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family,
were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the
chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine
place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no
little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.
A most welcome negative followed the last question – and
her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to
feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself;
and when the subject was revived the next morning, and
she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with
a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any
dislike to the scheme.

To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
