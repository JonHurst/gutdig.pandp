But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared
away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster,
the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her
to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young
woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good
humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia
to each other, and out of their {{three}} months’ acquaintance
they had been intimate {{two}}.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of
Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification
of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive
to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in
restless ecstacy, calling for every one’s congratulations, and
laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst
the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her
fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask {{me}} as
well as Lydia,” said she, “though I am {{not}} her particular
friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has,
and more too, for I am two years older.”

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable,
and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself,
this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same
feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered
it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make
her were it known, she could not help secretly advising
her father not to let her go. She represented to him all
the improprieties of Lydia’s general behaviour, the little
advantage she could derive from the friendship of such
a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being
yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton,
where the temptations must be greater than at home.
He heard her attentively, and then said,

“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself
in some public place or other, and we can never expect her
to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her
family as under the present circumstances.”
