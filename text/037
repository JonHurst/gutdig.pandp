“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both
laughed heartily.

“If they had uncles enough to fill {{all}} Cheapside,” cried
Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”

“But it must very materially lessen their chance of
marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied
Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters
gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for
some time at the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar
relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired
to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with
her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly,
and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the
evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep,
and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant
that she should go down stairs herself. On entering the
drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was
immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them
to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister
the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short
time she could stay below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked
at her with astonishment.

“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that
is rather singular.”

“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards.
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else.”

“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried
Elizabeth; “I am {{not}} a great reader, and I have pleasure
in many things.”

“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,”
said Bingley; “and I hope it will soon be increased by
seeing her quite well.”

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked
towards a table where a few books were lying. He immediately
offered to fetch her others; all that his library
afforded.
