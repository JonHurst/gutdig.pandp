thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was
impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish
of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the
highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and
when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner
were half a quarter of a mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house – but she
declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the
lawn. At such a time, much might have been said, and
silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she
recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked
of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet
time and her aunt moved slowly – and her patience and
her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up, they were
all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment;
but this was declined, and they parted on each
side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth
saw him walking slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and
each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to
any thing they had expected. “He is perfectly well
behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.

“There {{is}} something a little stately in him to be sure,”
replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is
not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper,
that though some people may call him proud, {{I}} have seen
nothing of it.”

“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to
us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and
there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance
with Elizabeth was very trifling.”

“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome
as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham’s
countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how
came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?”
