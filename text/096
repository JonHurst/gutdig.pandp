he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose
Mr. Darcy’s regard.”

“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”

“No; he never saw him till the other morning at
Meryton.”

“This account then is what he has received from
Mr. Darcy. I am perfectly satisfied. But what does he
say of the living?”

“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances,
though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than
once, but he believes that it was left to him {{conditionally}}
only.”

“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said
Elizabeth warmly; “but you must excuse my not being
convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley’s defence of
his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he
is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has
learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture
still to think of both gentlemen as I did before.”

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying
to each, and on which there could be no difference of
sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy,
though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley’s
regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley
himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose
inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had
scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so
fortunate as to make a most important discovery.

“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident,
that there is now in the room a near relation of my
patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself
mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of
her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort
of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting
with – perhaps – a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh
