something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come?
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now
is your time. Here are officers enough at Meryton to
disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let
Wickham be {{your}} man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would
jilt you creditably.”

“Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy
me. We must not all expect Jane’s good fortune.”

“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think
that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an
affectionate mother who will always make the most of it.”

Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling
the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had
thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw
him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what
Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy,
and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly
acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body
was pleased to think how much they had always disliked
Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose
there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case,
unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and
steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged
the possibility of mistakes – but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
