“And they {{must}} marry! Yet he is {{such}} a man!”

“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to
be done. But there are two things that I want very much
to know: – one is, how much money your uncle has laid
down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever
to pay him.”

“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you
mean, Sir?”

“I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia
on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during
my life, and fifty after I am gone.”

“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had
not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged,
and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my
uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”

“No,” said her father, “Wickham’s a fool, if he
takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.
I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning
of our relationship.”

“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half
such a sum to be repaid?”

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep
in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.
Their father then went to the library to write, and the
girls walked into the breakfast-room.

“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth,
as soon as they were by themselves. “How strange this
is! And for {{this}} we are to be thankful. That they should
marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched
as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”

“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that
he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real
regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something
towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand
pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced. He has
children of his own, and may have more. How could he
spare half ten thousand pounds?”
