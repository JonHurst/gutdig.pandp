read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will
have no reserves from {{you}}.” “Mr. Darcy is impatient
to see his sister, and to confess the truth, {{we}} are
scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do
not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,
elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she
inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something
still more interesting, from the hope we dare to
entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not
know whether I ever before mentioned to you my
feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country
without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem
them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly
already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing
her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish
the connection as much as his own, and a sister’s partiality
is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these
circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent
it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope
of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?”

“What think you of {{this}} sentence, my dear Lizzy?” – said
Jane as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? – Does
it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects
nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced
of her brother’s indifference, and that if she suspects
the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!)
to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion
on the subject?”

“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. – Will
you hear it?”

“Most willingly.”

“You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees
that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to
marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in the hope
of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.”

Jane shook her head.
