“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say
but it would not be near so much like a ball.”

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards
got up and walked about the room. Her figure was
elegant, and she walked well; – but Darcy, at whom it
was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and,
turning to Elizabeth, said,

I should be completely in your way; – and if the second,
I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.”

“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard
