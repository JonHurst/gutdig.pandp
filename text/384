the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth,
though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes
think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy
exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. He bore it however with admirable calmness.
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented
him on carrying away the brightest jewel of
the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting
frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure.
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William
was out of sight.

Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a
greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips,
as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to
speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good humour
encouraged, yet, whenever she {{did}} speak, she must be
vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her
more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth
did all she could, to shield him from the frequent
notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to
herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable
feelings arising from all this took from the season
of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the
future; and she looked forward with delight to the time
when they should be removed from society so little
pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their
family party at Pemberley.
