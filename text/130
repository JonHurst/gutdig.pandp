her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went
she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss
Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house,
she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever
Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be
anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she
spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving
to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon
as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all
this to her husband.

“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to
think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of
this house, that I should be forced to make way for {{her}},
and live to see her take my place in it!”

“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.
Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves
that {{I}} may be the survivor.”

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore,
instead of making any answer, she went on as before,

“I cannot bear to think that they should have all
this estate. If it was not for the entail I should not
mind it.”

“What should not you mind?”

“I should not mind any thing at all.”

“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state
of such insensibility.”

“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing
about the entail. How any one could have the conscience
to entail away an estate from one’s own daughters
I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins
too! – Why should {{he}} have it more than anybody else?”

“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.
