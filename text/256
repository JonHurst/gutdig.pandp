inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to
be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who,
fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth’s
arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and
they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady
