she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband
all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any
thing else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s
walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in
quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was
spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after
many years discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to
leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new
friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think
with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and above all, of his
wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
