Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said
that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than
before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as
this morning.

“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his
civilities,” replied her uncle. “Your great men often are;
and therefore I shall not take him at his word about
fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and

be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they
were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures,
every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and
