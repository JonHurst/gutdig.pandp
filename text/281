“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep
our engagement. {{That}} is all settled.”

“That is all settled;” repeated the other, as she ran
into her room to prepare. “And are they upon such
terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that
I knew how it was!”

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to
amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following
hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she
would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had
her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst
the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends
in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn,
nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth,
after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in
a shorter space of time than she could have supposed,
seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
