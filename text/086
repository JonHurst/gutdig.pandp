imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such
a history of himself as he gave me last night; names,
facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony. – If it be
not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was
truth in his looks.”

“It is difficult indeed – it is distressing. – One does not
know what to think.”

“I beg your pardon; – one knows exactly what to
think.”

But Jane could think with certainty on only one
point, – that Mr. Bingley, if he {{had been}} imposed on,
would have much to suffer when the affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery
where this conversation passed, by the arrival of
some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking;
Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which
was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were
delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age
since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had
been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest
of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone
again, rising from their seats with an activity which took
their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager
to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely
agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet
chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest
daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the
invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious
card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening
in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their
brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing
a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation
of every thing in Mr. Darcy’s looks and behaviour.
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia,
