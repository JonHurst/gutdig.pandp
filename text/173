her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more
openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,

“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is
it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet?
Let me hear what it is.”

“We are speaking of music, Madam,” said he, when
no longer able to avoid a reply.

“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all

If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.

that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times,
that she will never play really well, unless she practises

know, in that part of the house.”

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill
breeding, and made no answer.
