highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and
often without any attention to the imperfection of the
performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning
that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you
should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort
of panegyric, of compliment to yourself – and yet what
is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must
leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real
advantage to yourself or any one else?”

“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember
at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself
to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least,
therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies.”

“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means
convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as
that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting
your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would
probably not go – and, at another word, might stay a
month.”

“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth,
“that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.
You have shewn him off now much more than
he did himself.”

“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your
converting what my friend says into a compliment on the
sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving
it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend;
for he would certainly think the better of me, if under
such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride
off as fast as I could.”

“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your
original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in
adhering to it?”
