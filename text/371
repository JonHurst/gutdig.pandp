have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred
to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd
and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never
had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that
I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done,
that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could
easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated,
I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of
directing his friend.

“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she,
“when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely
from my information last spring?”

“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during
the two visits which I had lately made her here; and
I was convinced of her affection.”

“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate
conviction to him.”

“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His
diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment
in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made
every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing,
which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could
not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in
town three months last winter, that I had known it, and
purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his
anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily
forgiven me now.”

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been
a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth
was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered
that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only
to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached
the house. In the hall they parted.
