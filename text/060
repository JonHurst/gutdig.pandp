and more teazing than usual to himself. He wisely
resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should {{now}} escape him, nothing that could elevate
her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that
if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during
the last day must have material weight in confirming or
crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten
words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though
they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour,
he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would
not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so
agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility
to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her
affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring
the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her
either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. – Elizabeth
took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their
mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and
thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and
was sure Jane would have caught cold again. – But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure,
was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance
in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they
were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and
almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough
bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to
admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality
to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for
them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday;
several of the officers had dined lately with their
uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually
been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
