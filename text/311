her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at
her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before
they took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had,
from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr.
Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for
since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal
its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not
immediately on the spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his
means. There were few people on whose secrecy she
would have more confidently depended; but at the same
time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister’s
frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however,
from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to
herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable
between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on
the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed
that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family,
where to every other objection would now be added, an
alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the
man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he
should shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which
she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could
not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though
she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his
esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited
by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed
the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced
that she could have been happy with him; when it was
no longer likely they should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could
he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned
only four months ago, would now have been gladly and
gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not,
