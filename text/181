her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find
it out. – She watched him whenever they were at Rosings,
and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much
success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal,
but the expression of that look was disputable. It was
an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether
there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed
nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the
possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth
always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not
think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment;
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt,
that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could
suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes
planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond
comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired
her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to
counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable
patronage in the church, and his cousin could
have none at all.
